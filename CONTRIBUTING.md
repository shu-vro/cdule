# SCHEDULE

## CONTRIBUTING

Thanks for reaching to this page. any contributing to this repository is gladly welcomed. 

### Steps

1. Clone this repo
    ```sh
    https://github.com/shu-vro/schedule.git
    cd schedule
    ```
2. Run the dev command
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

**!important**: This repository heavily depends on npm. so please develop using `node package manager: npm`.

The reason for this is it installs `next-pwa` which comes with necessary dependencies like `workbox` and related modules by default when using `npm`.
however, they can be manually be downloaded which I didn't like (I'm lazy)

3. Create your branch. The naming convension is `<your-name>/<issue-num>` if issue number is not applicable, you can simply put `<your-name>`. You must put your name in the branch name.
4. Push your code into the branch and it will be reviewed

*Finally, thanks for contributing this repository*
