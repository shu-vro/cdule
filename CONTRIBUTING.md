# CDULE

## CONTRIBUTING

Thanks for reaching to this page. any contributing to this repository is gladly welcomed.

### Steps

1. Clone this repo
    ```sh
    https://github.com/shu-vro/cdule.git
    cd cdule
    ```
2. Run the dev command
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

**!important**: This repository heavily depends on npm. so please develop using `node package manager: npm`.

The reason for this is it installs `next-pwa` which comes with necessary dependencies like `workbox` and related modules by default when using `npm`.
however, they can be manually be downloaded which I didn't like (I'm lazy)

3. Create your branch. The naming convension is `<your-name>/<issue-num>` if issue number is not applicable, you can simply put `<your-name>`. You must put your name in the branch name.
4. Push your code into the branch and it will be reviewed

Otherwise, if you have any feature request or issue in this app, you can visit the issue panel and submit an issue.
